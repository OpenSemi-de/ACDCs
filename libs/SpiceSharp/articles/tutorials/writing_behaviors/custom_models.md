# Custom models

In this chapter we will discuss how we can build our own custom models. In order to do so, we first need to understand *how* the simulator works.

I recommend the following prior knowledge:
- Some linear algebra:
  - Matrix notation for systems of equations
- Some calculus:
  - Derivatives and partial derivatives
- Some basic electronics:
  - Knowledge of *Kirchoff's Current Law* will help.
  - Knowledge of *Nodal Analysis* will help.
  - Knowledge of basic electrical components will help.
